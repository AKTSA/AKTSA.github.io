							<h3>AP Computer Science</h3>
							<p>This is a college-level introductory course in computer science. Because the design and implementation of computer programs to solve problems involve skills that are fundamental to the study of computer science, a large part of the course is built around the development of computer programs that correctly solve a given problem. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is used as a context for introducing other important aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. In addition, the responsible use of these systems is an integral part of the course.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="ClassOpen" id="ClassOpen1">
							<h3>Scientific Visualization</h3>
							<p>This course introduces students to the use of complex graphic tools. Emphasis is placed on the principles, concepts, and use of complex graphic and visualization tools as applied to the study of science and technology. Students use complex 2D graphics, animation, editing, and image analysis tools to better understand, illustrate, explain, and present technical, mathematical, and/or scientific concepts and principles. Emphasis is placed on the use of computer-enhanced images to generate both conceptual and data-driven models, data-driven charts and animations. Science, math, and visual design concepts are reinforced throughout the course. Activities are structured to integrate physical and social sciences, mathematics, English language arts, and art.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="ClassOpen" id="ClassOpen2">
							<h3>Drafting</h3>
							<p>This course introduces students to the use of simple and complex graphic tools used to communicate and understand ideas and concepts found in the areas of architecture, manufacturing, engineering, science, and mathematics. Topics include problem-solving strategies, classical representation methods such as sketching, geometric construction techniques, as well as computer assisted design (CAD), orthographic projection, and 3D modeling.</p>

					<h2>Student Projects</h2>

					<div>
						<p>Our students engage in a wide variety of real world and hands-on projects. Click to learn about a few of them.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="ProjInfo">
						<p style="display:block;">Students from AK TSA built robots to perform specific tasks both under drive control and autonomously for competition.</p>
						<p>This is a two-point perspective picture created by a Drafting 1 student. Students started out by drawing two points on the page and then using shapes that would converge at one of those two points to create a realistic picture.</p>
						<p>This is a puzzle cube engineered from start to finish by an Intro to Engineering Design student. The students were required to brainstorm over 25 different parts and then create 5 possible designs for a puzzle cube and afterward to pick one and build it.</p>
						<p>PLTW: Principles of Engineering students built this bridge and tested it for its efficiency. It came out with an efficiency over 2000 to win the award for top efficiency in these students' class.</p>
						<p>Drafting 2 students create architectural plans using CAD programs as part of their class projects and eventually go on to build full, real life models of these plans.</p>
						<p>Students from AK TSA create a website for a fictional music band.</p>

							<h3>Jason Sheffield</h3>
							<p>My name is Jason Sheffield and I have been a teacher here at Ardrey Kell High School since 2011, prior to that, I spent 18 years teaching at Harding University High School. I have a Master's Degree in Trade and Industrial Education form North Carolina A&amp;T and a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tennessee (Go Vols). I grew up in England and spend way too much time watching the beautiful game. I have been blessed to have found a woman way too good for me who inexplicably married me in 1992 - Suzanne is an Exceptional Children's teacher at Independence High School. Suzanne and I are the proud parents of a wonderful young man - Gabriel Quinn.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="InfoCell" id="TeachInfo1">
							<h3>Elaine Friar</h3>
							<p>I am Elaine Friar and I have taught Business Education for 20 years. I am originally from South Carolina and received my B.S. in Business Education from Winthrop College (long before its name changed to Winthrop University). I have taught in several different states as I followed my husband in his navy career. We moved to Charlotte in 2000 along with our two children, Claudia and AJ. I earned my Master's of Education from the University of Maryland. In 2005, I became a National Board Certified teacher in Career and Technical Education. At this time, I am a sponsor of the National Technical Honor Society (NTHS) and Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). All business students should join FBLA and participate at the school, district, state and national competitions. Please encourage your juniors and seniors to excel so that they may become a member of NTHS, the prestigious honor society for Career and Technical Education students.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="InfoCell" id="TeachInfo2">
							<h3>John Glenn</h3>
							<p>My name is John Glenn, and I am the Drafting and Civil Engineering teacher at Ardrey Kell High School. I am a native Charlottean and attended South Mecklenburg High School, graduating in 1983. I attended both the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, graduating from NC State in 1989 with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Industrial Arts Education. Upon graduation I taught Technology Education for eight years at South Mecklenburg High School, then taught Tech. Ed. at David W. Butler High School for one year in 1998. I spent the next ten years working in the home-building industry as a CAD operator and CAD Department Manager for Shea Homes in Charlotte. In 2008 I re-entered the teaching profession at Harding University High School teaching Drafting and Civil Engineering. In 2011, I was fortunate enough to be able to transfer to Ardrey Kell High School...without a doubt, the best place to teach in North Carolina! I have been married to my wife Shelby for 26 years, and have two children. My son Daniel is married to Samantha Glenn, and lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, and my daughter Kelli is a junior at Western Carolina University majoring in Psychology. I also have a Jack Russell terrier named 'Jack' of all things. He showed up at my house and adopted my family about 5 years ago! I also have a sweet bulldog named Tigger. She's an old girl now, but the best dog anybody ever had. I also have two cats, but what can you say about cats?! They do their thing, and I do mine. I enjoy sports: baseball and football in particular, but my favorite sport, or hobby if you will is fly fishing for trout in the mountains of North Carolina. Nothing beats wading in cold clear streams and being in some of the most beautiful country on Earth!  I fully believe God spent just a little more time on the Appalachians than he did anywhere else! If I am not here...I'm gone fishin'!</p>
